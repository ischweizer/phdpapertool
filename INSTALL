Installation Howto

0. laravel expects public/ to be the document root.

1a. Copy template.env.php to .env.php.
1b. Modify ".env.php" for the environment.

2a. Make sure mod_rewrite is enabled and overriding .htaccess is allowed.

3a. Get composer (see https://getcomposer.org/download/)
3b. Run "php composer.phar install" (or "composer install" depending on how you installed composer) 
3c. Alternatively run "php composer.phar update" (or "composer update"). Should not be used in production environment as dependencies may have been updated (i.e. should be tested again).
	Whenever someone used update and composer.lock changed everyone has to run "install"

4. Create the mysql database you specified in 1b.

5. Run "php artisan migrate" to bring your database up to date.
	Whenever someone pushed a migration this has to be done. To be sure, run it after each upgrade.

6. Install a cronjob for delivering time dependend emails, the cronjob has to execute the command "php artisan cronjob:mail". A daily execution makes the most sense.

7. Login as Super-Admin and change its information.
   The default login is admin@example.org with password 1234. You should log in and change the mail address and password. The Super-Admin account is not meant to be used for other features except to accept lab-creation-requests or similar.
   If you yourself want to actively use the platform, you should register another user.
